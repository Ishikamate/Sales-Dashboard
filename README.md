### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "Arrival Delay".
- Step 5 : For calculating average delay time, null values were not taken into account as only less than 1% values are null in this column(i.e column named "Arrival Delay") 
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 : Since the data contains various ratings, thus in order to represent ratings, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 8 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named "Class", "Customer Type", "Gate Location" & "Type of travel".
- Step 9 : Two card visuals were added to the canvas, one representing average departure delay in minutes & other representing average arrival delay in minutes.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
           
           
  # Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)
To create the necessary data model for doing analysis and fulfilling the business needs defined in the user stories the following tables were extracted using SQL.

One data source (sales budgets) were provided in Excel format and were connected in the data model in a later step of the process.

Below are the SQL statements for cleansing and transforming necessary data.
